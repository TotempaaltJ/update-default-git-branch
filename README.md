# Rename repos

Will create a new branch on Github and change the default branch to it, and then delete the old one.

How to use:

```bash
# ./rename-github-default-branch.sh <USER> <REPO> <from-branch-name> <to-branch-name>
# ./rename-for-all-repos.sh <USER> <from-branch-name> <to-branch-name>
```
